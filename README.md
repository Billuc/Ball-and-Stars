# Ball-and-Stars

My first ever personnal Java Project and game, and maybe the biggest game I ever finished ^^'
You control the ball using the left and right arrows. Your goal is to capture all the stars by bouncing on different blocks.


This project allowed me to learn how to create GUIs, how to create a keyboard-controlled game and how to make all the operations behind the game.
Obviously, the architecture of the application and the GUI are quite bad, since it is a very early project.
There is no MVC architecture and the GUI can be greatly improved, but I will leave it as it is, since I like the "nostalgy" it gives me ;)
